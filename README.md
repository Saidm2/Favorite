# Lakers
I am going to be telling you about why **Lakers** are my favorite team

## 1. Lebron James is on the team
Lebron is a well known legend in basketball, he's an inpsiring role model for me and many young athletes today. He started from the bottom and became one of the greatest player in history. 
## 2. *Purple and Yellow* color fit together and i really like it
## 3. Because there final games are really fun to watch
