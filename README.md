# Lakers
I am going to be telling you about why **Lakers** are my favorite team

## 1. Lebron James is on the team
Lebron is a well known legend in basketball, he's an inpsiring role model for me and many young athletes today. He started from the bottom and became one of the greatest player in history. 
## 2. The team colors,*Purple and Yellow*, are some of my favorite colors and they compliment eachother very well 
## 3. Their final games are really fun to watch with family and friends
